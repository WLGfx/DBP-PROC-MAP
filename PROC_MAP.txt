PROC_MAP plugin by Carl S Norwood (WLGfx 2012)

Procedural 3D Level Generator V4.1 (beta)

This plugin is provided free to the Dark Basic Pro community.

You may use this plugin for anything you like with no restrictions.

If you really want to, then just add a credit mentioning me.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

Copy the PROC_MAP.dll to compiler/plugins-user dir
Copy the PROC_MAP.ini to editor/keywords dir

(both in your DBPro installation folder)

-----------------------------------------------------------

This plugin will generate a complete 3D model made up of segments
depending on the map size you specify. Each segment generated will
either be a room or a corridor.

Both the rooms and corridors have an inner set of edges and an
outer set of edges. Some of the functions will provide access for
getting the centre coordinates of either an inner or outer edge.
This is useful for placing objects at specific positions within
the 3d model that's been generated. Using the maps height, you can also
place items not just on the floor of the level but also on the walls
and the roof. Item placement can be made better also by fetching the
edges angle of rotation.

You can also determine the type of any segment whether it is a room
or a corridor. Use this for customising your own texturing or coloring
the segments.

TODO: add the functions to reteive the rooms entry edges so doors can
be placed on the map.

Commands and Functions:

Note, that the deafult values in the first few functions are a guide
line as to how the algorithm is to be setup.

PMAP SET MAP DATA size, seed, height, tess
	size 	= number of segments to generate
	seed 	= random seed setting
	height	= noise height to create the sloping dungeon
	tess	= 0 no tessellation / 1 tessellation (only 1 level for now)

PMAP SET CORRIDOR lmin, lmax, amin, amax, smin, smax
	lmin/lmax	= corridors edge length range (defaults 80, 120)
	amin/amax	= angle range for corridor (defaults 60, 120)
	smin/smax	= valid segment creation range (defaults 6, 16)

PMAP SET ROOM lmin, lmax, smin, smax
	lmin/lmax	= rooms outer edge length range (defaults 80, 150)
	smin/smax	= rooms outer edges count range (defaults 10, 20)

PMAP SEL IN EDGE seg, edge
	seg		= segment number
	edge	= edge number
	(selects the inner edge for retreiving data fast see below)

PMAP SEL OUT EDGE seg, edge
	seg		= segment number
	edge	= edge number
	(selects the outer edge for retreiving data fast see below)

x# = PMAP EDGE CENTRE X()
	(retreives the x coordinate of the centre of the selected edge)

y# = PMAP EDGE CENTRE Y()

z# = PMAP EDGE CENTRE Z()

a# = PMAP EDGE ANGLE()
	(returns the edges angle on the x and z axis, useful for 
	rotating objects being placed)

i = PMAP GET IN COUNT(seg)
	(gets the number of inner edges of a segment)

o = PMAP GET OUT COUNT(seg)
	(gets the number of outer edges of a segment)

PMAP TEXTURE CORRIDOR floor$, wall$, roof$
	(Load and sets the corridors textures, done before generation)

PMAP TEXTURE ROOM floor$, wall$, roof$
	(Load and sets the rooms textures, done before generation)
	
PMAP TEXTURE CORRIDOR IDS floor, wall, roof
	(Set the texture IDs for the corridors, done before generation)

PMAP TEXTURE ROOM IDS floor, wall, roof
	(Set the texture IDs for the rooms, done before generation)

PMAP GENERATE
	(Generates and creates the 3D level)

ID = PMAP OBJECT ID()
	(Returns the levels object number)

PMAP CLEAR ALL
	(Frees all the images, object and other stuff used)

PMAP TEXTURE SEGMENT FLOOR seg, ID
	seg = segment number
	ID  = image ID
	(Textures the floor of a segment)

PMAP TEXTURE SEGMENT WALL seg, ID
	(see above)

PMAP TEXTURE SEGMENT ROOF seg, ID
	(see above)

PMAP COLOR SEGMENT FLOOR seg, color
	(sets the color of a segments floor)

PMAP COLOR SEGMENT WALL seg, color
	(as above)

PMAP COLOR SEGMENT ROOF seg, color
	(as above)

t = PMAP SEGMENT TYPE(seg)
	(returns 0 if corridor and 1 if room)
